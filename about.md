### About Me ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a software engineer at Meta working on EMG Neuromotor Interfaces. I've worked on deployment on machine learning models onto low-power embedded devices, as well as the infrastructure to help researchers bring ideas into a real product.

Previously, I've worked at Amazon (Tax Engine), Jump Trading, Correlation One (Recruiting for Quant firms), and Meta (Computer Vision / Video OCR)
