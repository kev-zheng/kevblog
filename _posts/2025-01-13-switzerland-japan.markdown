#### Booking Details 

##### Inbound

After a couple days of browsing, I found the following flights on Aeroplan for **87,500** points. I was particularly excited to try Singapore Airlines business class.

{% include image.html path="photos/2025-01-13-switzerland-japan/jfk_fra_nrt.png" %}

Then, I found out about Air Canada's great stopover policy. You can add 1 stopover on most tickets as a multi-city/stopover booking for 5,000 points. I figured, let's break up the trip and add skiing in Switzerland.

Unfortunately, since I did not book the flex ticket for free changes, I paid a ~100 CAD change fee.

Swiss business class, at least at the time of booking, is quite easy to find year round.

{% include image.html path="photos/2025-01-13-switzerland-japan/jfk_zrh_nrt.png" %}

Swiss First Class, on the other hand, is much harder to book. No other programs other than Swiss can book it with points, and it commands a steep $16k price tag. I've [heard](https://onemileatatime.com/insights/swiss-777-first-class/) of bloggers being able to upgrade their flight at check-in. Maybe I'd try that out, because when else am I going to try it?

For Cathy, since she was already going to be in Hawaii, I booked her JL economy via Qantas for ~30k points. Later, I found premium economy availability for 40k points and switched her onto that.

##### Outbound

Initially, I wanted to find a way to Mexico around ~1/29 for a friend's wedding.

ANA flies NRT/MEX. However, there was no availability, and historically it seems they never fly their new cabin on this route.

The best option with availability seemed to be Japan Airlines. I was able to find reasonably plentiful availability on married segments, such as (Some city in Japan)-(HND/NRT)-(USA)
* Since we are going to be in Hokkaido, finding a flight starting in AKJ/CTS was ideal.
* I booked CTS-HND-DFW, with the added plus of being able to fly the new JL A350 business class seat.
* This cost **75,000** Alaska miles, which is transferable from Amex via Hawaiian Airlines.
* As I was monitoring this daily, I also found availability for AKJ-HND-LAX, ITM-HND-SFO, etc.
* Changing the flights is relatively easy. You can't change it on the website due to Alaska IT - your options are:
  * call/text Alaska to help them change it for you
  * cancel the flight online and book it after points redeposit. This will lose you the $12.50 nonrefundable partner booking fee.
* I did the second option several times... and that partner booking fee adds up.

{% include image.html path="photos/2025-01-13-switzerland-japan/cts_hnd_dfw.png" %}

Later, through seats.aero alerts, I was able to book ANA First Class NRT-ORD on Virgin Atlantic for **61,000** Amex points (after a 40% transfer bonus)!

Here's what the final itinerary looks like!
